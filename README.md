# Restful API's using Express.js

Create a Restful API for a Note taking application. You should be able to `Create`, `Read`, `Update` and `Delete` a particular note. Also, create one api to fetch all the Notes. 

1. Get all the notes. (It should also support sorting the notes by it's date of creation)
2. Get a single note by it's ID.
3. Create a new note.
4. Update a existing note.
5. Delete a existing note.

- Test your API's using Postman.
- Send back proper Http status codes and error messages on invalid requests.
- Write modular code with the help of Express router.
- Create a middleware to validate the request body.
- Error Handling should be in place.
- Setup Eslint with Airbnb and resolve all lint errors and warnings.

Make sure **Note** has atleast these 4 properties. 
 - noteId
 - noteTitle
 - noteDescription
 - createdAt

Feel free to add more properties to the Note object as per your requirements.

CD should be configured and the API's should be deployed on Heroku.

# Post Submission


A mentor will review your submission, and will open an issue with review comments. Please allow only the mentor to close this issue.
You must resolve all the review comments, and re-submit the assignment, by creating a new tag and pushing:

- For first refactor, tag with `git tag refactor-1`, and push: `git push origin master`. Update this with refactor-2, and so on for subsequent submissions.
